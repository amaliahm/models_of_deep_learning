# 🧠 Models of Deep Learning

This repository is a structured collection of deep learning models and experiments implemented using both **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**. It serves as a personal learning lab where I run and explore foundational and advanced architectures to deepen my understanding of Deep Learning techniques.

## 🔍 Goals

- Run and analyze deep learning models in both **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow 1.x**.
- Understand the mechanics and training dynamics behind different architectures: CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, GANs, Autoencoders, etc.
- Compare implementations across frameworks.
- Document any insights, tweaks, or performance observations along the way.

## 🧾 Credits

- Original code and concepts are sourced from educational content, open-source contributions, and publicly available notebooks.
- This project is purely for **self-study** and **academic exploration**.
